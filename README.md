This was a group project tasked by my bootcamp based on a theme **'City Hacking'. 

It is a Jobhunting website like any other, but the main feature is the **Hunt Engine**, which was made 100% ReactJS.
**Hunt Engine** ables to scrap other job websites and return the results back. With different filters it's easy to browse around.
